    "![](images/overview-fig1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instruction (or function) execution\n",
    "\n",
    "In general terms, _all_ computation, all functions, all fancy libraries written by anyone, must eventually be translated to the functions or instructions which come built-in to a CPU. You might be surprised to learn that modern cpus only have a few hundred instructions!\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, for our purpose, think of cpus containing three types of instructions: arithmetic, control flow and memory related.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Arithmetic operations\n",
    "Cpus contain _many_ instructions of type \n",
    "\n",
    "`add_int   arg1 arg2 output`\n",
    "\n",
    "`add_float arg1 arg2 output`\n",
    "\n",
    "`mult_int   arg1 arg2 output`\n",
    "\n",
    "`mult_float arg1 arg2 output`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax shown above is not standard, but it demonstrates that there are instructions for basic math. Since the code to add two integer numbers must be different from the code to add to floating point numbers, there are separate instructions. Higher level languages, like Python, may provide a single interface and hide away type complexity, but low level code always differentiates. There are no optional arguments, no default values, no such niceties in low level programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice also that these functions have three parameters. The last parameter is the output location of the result. We will understand this better after we study registers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Memory operations\n",
    "Memory load/store instructions are perhaps not as obvious ass arithmetic operations. Load/store operations can be thought of as these examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "`load src_memory_index dst_register`\n",
    "\n",
    "`store src_register dst_memory`\n",

    "`lt arg1 arg2 out`\n",
    "`lteq arg1 arg2 out`\n",
    "\n",
    "The instructions above are simplified examples of `compare`, `less than` and `less than or equal to`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Control flow operations\n",
    "The last major type of instructions consist of control flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "`jmp iftrue jmp_location`\n",
    "\n",
    "These instructions correspond to if/else statements or loop constructs in higher level languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Registers\n",
    "\n",
    "In an earlier example, we show the following (simplified) instruction:\n",
    "\n",
    "`add_int arg1 arg2 output`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this instruction, `arg1` and `arg2` can be integers or locations of a register. The `output` parameter refers to a register location.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Registers_ can be thought of as a tiny amount of memory attached to a cpu. Think of registers as a tiny array which can only hold a few tens of integers (32-128 are common numbers of registers). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since computers can't possibly run with such small amount of memory, many instructions, as we saw earlier, load data from main memory into these registers and copy contents of these registers back to main memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Programs are just data, loaded from memory\n",
    "\n",
    "The cpu needs to load programs from main memory, into its local memory (different from data registers). These programs, themselves, are nothing more than the types of instructions we saw above. _All_ programs, C, Python, R, Java eventually get translated to the types of instructions we saw above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Registers only contain zeros and ones\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have heard the expression that everything is zeros and ones to a computer. This is where that expression becomes a reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern cpu registers are made up of 64 _bits_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Register 1 `|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|..._|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|`\n",

You can probably tell from context, all numbers, strings, pictures, videos, video games, web pages, programs, must be converted to a set of zeros and ones. We will look at how to do so in a later section.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### There are cache layers between registers and memory\n",
    "Earlier we saw an example of a memory operation: `load src_memory_index dst_register`\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, this operation is will not _necessarily_ pull a value from memory and put it in the target register. That will be an _extremely_ expensive operation. There are several layers of `caches` which try to reduce register to memory traffic. Later in this lecture we will see an important link about the cost of accessing data from cache vs memory.\n",
